# Semantic-Image-Inpainting
Simplely implement the paper 'Semantic Image Inpainting with Deep Generative Models'

## Indroduction
This code simplely implement the paper [Semantic Image Inpainting with Deep Generative Models](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Yeh_Semantic_Image_Inpainting_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf). The results of the paper have good results of face inpainting.

## Method
The method of the paper is divided into two stages,
First, train the [DCGAN](http://cn.arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) to get the pretrained model(generator, discriminator).

Second, use the pretrained model of DCGAN from the first stage.
